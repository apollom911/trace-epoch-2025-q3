TRACE Epoch · Exhibit D — Anchoring Note

Purpose:
This Anchoring Note records the public blockchain transaction that immutably 
anchors the Exhibit A Hash Manifest. It proves that the manifest and its SIM-01 
through SIM-17 hashes existed as of the block timestamp, ensuring temporal integrity.

Details to be completed after anchoring transaction is broadcast:

SHA256(manifest) = __________________________

Anchored via [Blockchain: Bitcoin / Ethereum / Other] 
TXID: __________________________

Block timestamp (UTC): __________________________

Notes:
- The TXID provides an immutable, publicly verifiable reference.
- Anyone may hash the Exhibit A manifest and confirm it matches the on-chain 
  value, ensuring integrity against the original publication date.
