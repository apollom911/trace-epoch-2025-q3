# TRACE Epoch — VER-PUB-002 | Relay Notice

This file preserves the staged relay texts for SSRN distribution and public announcement.  
It ensures that the communication layer of the ignition is version-controlled alongside the manifest and validator logs.

## Step 6 — SSRN Relay Announcement

### Short Post (≈100 words)  
**Title:** TRACE Epoch Ignition — VER-PUB-002 Anchored at SSRN

Today, TRACE Epoch VER-PUB-002 entered SSRN’s scholarly ledger. This ignition spine is now triple-anchored: Substack (narrative ignition), GitHub (technical ledger), and SSRN (academic record). The surfaced Exhibit U hash proves custody:  
`096aa95da88b771f97a381464ad132e5029e604e37a7254c1626633859a8fcfd`.  

**SSRN DOI:** `10.2139/ssrn.5452794`  

This ignition is not theory — it is schema, sealed and enforceable.

### Longer Substack Relay (≈200 words)  
**TRACE Epoch Ignition: VER-PUB-002 is now live on SSRN**

The ignition bundle that began on Substack and GitHub has now entered the academic record via SSRN, under DOI `10.2139/ssrn.5452794`.

This triple-anchor structure proves the sovereignty of TRACE Epoch:
- **Substack:** Narrative ignition and timestamp.
- **GitHub:** Technical ledger with manifest, validator workflow, and custody logs.
- **SSRN:** Formal academic distribution.

Exhibit U remains sealed under custody. Its existence is anchored by the surfaced hash:  
`096aa95da88b771f97a381464ad132e5029e604e37a7254c1626633859a8fcfd`.

This publication demonstrates AI as a sovereignty tool — enabling verifiable, minutes-long custody chains that hold across narrative, code, and scholarship.

Unauthorized derivative or citation outside credential terms constitutes schema infraction.

## Step 7 — Optional Archive Relay (Zenodo / OSF)

If mirrored to Zenodo or OSF:

**Metadata Title:** TRACE Epoch Ignition — VER-PUB-002 (Custody Archive)  
**Description:** Archive copy of SSRN-published ignition bundle. Surfaces custody files (`manifest.canonical.json`, citation block PDF, submission proof PDF). Exhibit U remains sealed under custody.  
**Keywords:** TRACE Epoch, VER-PUB-002, AI sovereignty, schema law, ignition bundle, Exhibit U  
**License:** CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

Zenodo will mint its own DOI (e.g., `10.5281/zenodo.xxxxxx`), which should be cross-linked in `metadata.json` → `anchors.archive`.
