## Controlled Access â€” Exhibit U

Exhibit U remains sealed under custody. Its integrity and existence are anchored by the surfaced hash:  

`096aa95da88b771f97a381464ad132e5029e604e37a7254c1626633859a8fcfd`  

For independent verification, controlled access may be granted under two conditions:  
1. Payment of a custody administration fee (tiered by requestor type).  
2. Execution of a mandatory legal agreement (confidentiality, limited-use, liability waiver, jurisdiction).  

Only after both conditions are met will a sealed custody excerpt of Exhibit U be released, logged, and cross-referenced in the Master Evidence Ledger.
