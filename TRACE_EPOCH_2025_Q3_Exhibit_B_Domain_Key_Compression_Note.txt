TRACE Epoch · Exhibit B — Domain Key Compression Note

Context:
The Verification Ledger Capsule (TRACE–VAL–SIM–PKT–01) uses sub-domain keys 
(HSM-KEY strings) for each individual SIM-01 through SIM-17. These keys ensure 
granularity and traceability within the capsule.

Discrepancy:
The Verification Ledger Capsule’s companion Verification Ledger Summary presents 
umbrella domain keys (e.g., Mobility, Healthcare, Finance). This is a compression 
layer intended for public readability and anchoring efficiency, not a replacement 
for the sub-domain keys.

Clarification:
- Sub-domain HSM-KEYs in SIM capsules are the canonical authority keys.
- Umbrella keys in the Ledger Summary are compression only, ensuring concise 
  public record but still provable against the raw SIM capsules.

Implication:
This publication of SIM-01 through SIM-17 constitutes the first public release of 
the sub-domain keys. Future validator overlays (e.g., Grok replay) will reference 
this packet as origin.
